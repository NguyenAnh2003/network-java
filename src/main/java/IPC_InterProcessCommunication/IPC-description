two types of processes
    Independent process
    Co-operating process

Independent is not affected by the execution of other processes.
Co-operating one can be affected by other executing processes.

+ In reality, there are many situations when co-operative nature can be utilized for increasing
    - computational speed
    - modularity

-> Inter-process communication (IPC) - a mechanism that allows processes to communicate with each
other and synchronize their actions. Processes can communicate with others through:
    - Shared memory
    - Message passing
